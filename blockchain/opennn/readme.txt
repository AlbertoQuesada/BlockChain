The .pro files are project files for the Qt Creator Integrated Development Environment, which can be downloaded from https://www.qt.io/download.

Note that OpenNN does not make use of the Qt library, it only uses the Qt Creator IDE. 

The documentation can be found at the official OpenNN site http://www.opennn.net.
